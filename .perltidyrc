-nsfs  # no space before "for" loop semicolon
-nolq  # don't outdent long quotes
-b     # edit file in place, leave .bak file
-nola  # don't outdent labels
-msc=2 # two spaces for post-line comments (not 4)
-bok   # keep old breaks before map/grep/sort (we're smarter than perltidy)

# dmo likes if( ), not if ( )
