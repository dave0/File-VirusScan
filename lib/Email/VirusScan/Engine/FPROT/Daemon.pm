=head1 NAME

Email::VirusScan::Engine::FPROT::Daemon - Email::VirusScan backend for scanning with clamd

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Email::VirusScanner;
    my $s = Email::VirusScanner->new({
	engines => {
		'-FPROT::Daemon' => {
			host      => '127.0.0.1',
			base_port => 10200,
		},
		...
	},
	...
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Email::VirusScan backend for scanning using F-PROT's scanner daemon

This class inherits from, and follows the conventions of,
Email::VirusScan::Engine.  See the documentation of that module for
more information.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new ( $conf )

Creates a new scanner object.  B<$conf> is a hashref containing:

=over 4

=item host

Required.

Host name or IP address of F-PROT daemon.  Probably will not work for
anything other than localhost or 127.0.0.1.

=item base_port

Optional.  Defaults to 10200.

Port at which we start looking for an F-PROT daemon.  We will try this
port, and four more above it.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 scan_path ( $pathname )

Scan the path provided using clamd on a the configured host.

Returns an Email::VirusScan::Result object.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<IO::Socket::INET>, L<Cwd>, L<Email::VirusScan::Result>
